# Price Contrast Chatbot

The Price Contrast Chatbot is a conversational AI tool for querying clothing products from a PostgreSQL database, enabling price comparisons across stores in Pakistanâ€™s clothing sector. Built with LangChain and the ChatGPT API, it handles natural language queries (e.g., "cheapest black shirt" or "Outfitters products under 5,000 PKR") and returns relevant product details. The frontend uses Next.js for a user-friendly chat interface, and the backend API is built with Python and FastAPI for scalability.
